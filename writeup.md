Description of the Two Features:

1. Search Feature: The search feature implemented in the Multimedia Web App allows users to search for specific files by their names. It filters the list of files based on the search term entered by the user, displaying only the files that match the search criteria. The search is case-insensitive, ensuring that files with matching names are shown regardless of the letter casing. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a quick and efficient way to locate specific files within a large collection.

2. Sort Feature: The sort feature implemented in the Multimedia Web App enables users to sort the list of files based on their names in ascending or descending order. It allows users to toggle between the two sorting options, providing flexibility in how they view and navigate through their files. This feature simplifies the file browsing experience by organizing the files in a more structured manner, making it easier for users to find and select the desired files.

Reasons for Choosing These Features:

These two features, search and sort, were chosen as they significantly improve the functionality and usability of the Multimedia Web App:

1. Search: With the ability to search for specific files, users can quickly locate their desired content without manually scrolling through a potentially large list of files. This saves time and effort, particularly in scenarios where the file collection is extensive. The search feature enhances user productivity and helps create a more efficient file management experience.

2. Sort: Sorting allows users to organize their files alphabetically, providing a logical order and making it easier to find files based on their names. This feature brings structure to the file browsing process, allowing users to navigate through their content more intuitively. Sorting helps users locate files more efficiently and contributes to an improved user experience.

Explanation of How the Code Works (Including the Search and Sort Features):

The code utilizes React and state management with hooks (useState and useEffect) to build the Multimedia Web App. The file data is stored in the `myFiles` state variable, which is initially populated with the `data` array. The `searchTerm` state variable holds the search term entered by the user.

For the search feature, the `filteredFiles` constant is derived by filtering the `myFiles` array based on the `name` property. The `filter` function checks if the lowercase version of the file name contains the lowercase version of the search term. This ensures a case-insensitive search. The filtered files are then displayed in the UI.

For the sort feature, the `filteredFiles` array is already filtered based on the search term. Sorting is achieved by calling the `sort` method on the `filteredFiles` array, with a comparison function that compares the `name` property of two files. The comparison function determines the sorting order based on whether the files should be in ascending or descending order. The sorted files are then displayed in the UI.

Both the search and sort features dynamically update the UI based on user input, ensuring that the file list is always up to date and responsive to user actions. These features provide a seamless and efficient file management experience within the Multimedia Web App.
